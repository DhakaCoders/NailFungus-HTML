          <p>Now I’m not exaggerating when I say that I’ve studied and reviewed pretty much every toenail fungus treatment and solution there is. </p>
          <p>And much like you, I’ve always been frustrated by the lack of results these treatments offered.  Sure, maybe the fungus goes away for a bit and you think you’ve gotten rid of it.</p>
          <p>But then…BAM! There it is again.</p>
          <p>Like a cancer that returns with a vengeance. Or a weed in your garden that just keeps coming back. And while there are some medications out there that do alleviate toenail fungus.</p>
          <p>They provide temporary relief at best. Plus, they often bring with them unwanted side-effects.</p>

          <p>Just take a look at the list of side effects associated with Jublia…</p>
          <p>Blistering, <strong>burning, itching, pain, stinging, or redness</strong> at the application site. Who needs that?</p>
          <p>Not to mention it’s an external treatment. Why is that important?</p>
          <p>Because what you’re about to discover is that toenail fungus is an inside job.</p>
          <p>And without addressing the internal causes…You’ll never get rid of it. Instead you’ll continue refilling your prescriptions while putting your health at risk. </p>

            <p>Because instead of trying to just address the symptoms of toenail fungus. </p>
            <p>It goes after the Three Root Causes of toenail fungus.</p>
            <p>That being said...Let me go ahead and give you a real birds eye view so you can see why you have toenail fungus in the first place. </p>
            <p>Then I’ll show you how to stop all three of these causes once and for all. </p>
            <p>Ridding you of your toenail fungus…and keeping it away for good.But before I do that I think it’s important for you to know that…</p>
            <p>Fungal infections on the skin are common. Toenail fungus also called onychomycosis (pronounced onako-my-kosis) is no exception.</p>

            <p>In fact, it’s estimated that up to 12% of the population suffers from toenail fungus. </p>
            <p>Which works out to be about 39 MILLION people. And fungus works a lot like those weeds in your garden I mentioned. The fungal spores latch onto anything and everything they come in contact with. </p>
            <p>Clothing, skin and even the air we breathe when the humidity is high enough. That's why there are so many people walking around with this problem…</p>
            <p>And it’s only getting worse. </p>
            <p>You see,  toenail fungus isn’t only in your toenails. It’s also in your blood…</p>
            <p>On your skin…In your  digestive system…And all over your house.</p>
            <p>It just happens to be most visible under your toenails. </p>
            <p>So now that you understand how fungus works.</p>

                    <p>And then immediately after that…I’ll show you how to conquer all three of them so that you finally get rid of that nasty fungus for good.</p>
                    <h2 class="nfm-yellow-title-01 lazy" data-src="assets/images/nfm-yellow-title-01.png">The first root cause</h2>
                    <strong>of toenail fungus is having cracked or brittle toenails.</strong>
                    <p>Having brittle nails can create a breeding environment for different types of nail fungus.</p>
                    <p>And if you’re not sure if you have brittle nails…Here are a few questions to help you determine if you do. Do your nails split at the ends? Do they peel back at the tips? Have you developed ridging on your nails? Are they difficult to grow?</p>
                    <div class="nfm-sub-3-con-img-1">
                      <img class="lazy" data-src="assets/images/nfm-sub-3-con-bg.png">
                    </div>
                    <p><strong>If the answer is yes to any of these questions…</strong></p>
                    <p>Then you have brittle and unhealthy nails. And when your nails are brittle and unhealthy they have a tendency to crack, making it easier for the fungus to get in.</p>
                    <p>Once the fungus infiltrates your toenails…it’s then able to thrive due to the warm and moist environment. </p>
                    <div class="nfm-sub-3-con-two-part clearfix">
                      <div class="nfm-sub-3-con-two-part-lft">
                        <p>So what causes your nails to become brittle? There are a variety of reasons.</p>
                        <p>For example…Problems with your Thyroid can weaken your nails and so can Psoriasis.  </p>
                        <p>Poor circulation can also weaken your nails. But a weak or compromised immune system is the most common reason for brittle and weak nails. </p>
                        <p>And any one of these issues can put you at risk for ultimately developing toenail fungus. </p>
                        <p>But even with most brittle toenails…you’ll never develop toenail fungus unless there’s a fungus present.</p>
