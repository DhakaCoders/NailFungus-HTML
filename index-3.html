          <p>Now I’m not exaggerating when I say that I’ve studied and reviewed pretty much every toenail fungus treatment and solution there is. </p>
          <p>And much like you, I’ve always been frustrated by the lack of results these treatments offered.  Sure, maybe the fungus goes away for a bit and you think you’ve gotten rid of it.</p>
          <p>But then…BAM! There it is again.</p>
          <p>Like a cancer that returns with a vengeance. Or a weed in your garden that just keeps coming back. And while there are some medications out there that do alleviate toenail fungus.</p>
          <p>They provide temporary relief at best. Plus, they often bring with them unwanted side-effects.</p>

            <p>Fungal infections on the skin are common. Toenail fungus also called <strong class="nfm-sub-txt-line"><u>onychomycosis (pronounced<br> onako-my-kosis)</u></strong> is no exception.</p>

            <p>In fact, it’s estimated that up to 12% of the population suffers from toenail fungus. </p>
            <p>Which works out to be about 39 MILLION people. And fungus works a lot like those weeds in your garden I mentioned. The fungal spores latch onto anything and everything they come in contact with. </p>
            <p>Clothing, skin and even the air we breathe when the humidity is high enough. That's why there are so many people walking around with this problem…</p>
            <p>And it’s only getting worse. </p>
            <p>You see,  toenail fungus isn’t only in your toenails. It’s also in your blood…</p>

                    <p>And then immediately after that…I’ll show you how to conquer all three of them so that you finally get rid of that nasty fungus for good.</p>
                    <h2 class="nfm-yellow-title-01 lazy" data-src="assets/images/nfm-yellow-title-01.png">The first root cause</h2>
                    <h2><strong>of toenail fungus is having cracked or brittle toenails.</strong></h2>
                    <p>Having brittle nails can create a breeding environment for different types of nail fungus.</p>
                    <p>And if you’re not sure if you have brittle nails…Here are a few questions to help you determine if you do. Do your nails split at the ends? Do they peel back at the tips? Have you developed ridging on your nails? Are they difficult to grow?</p>
                    <div class="nfm-sub-3-con-img-1">
                      <img class="lazy" data-src="assets/images/nfm-sub-3-con-bg.png">
                    </div>
                    <p><strong class="nfm-sub-txt-line"><u>If the answer is yes to any of these questions…</u></strong></p>
                    <p>Then you have brittle and unhealthy nails. And when your nails are brittle and unhealthy they have a tendency to crack, making it easier for the fungus to get in.</p>
                    <p>Once the fungus infiltrates your toenails…it’s then able to thrive due to the warm and moist environment. </p>
                    <div class="nfm-sub-3-con-two-part clearfix">
                      <div class="nfm-sub-3-con-two-part-rgt">

                      <div class="nfm-sub-3-con-two-part-lft">
                        <p>So what causes your nails to become brittle? There are a variety of reasons.</p>
                        <p>For example…Problems with your Thyroid can weaken your nails and so can Psoriasis.  </p>
                        <p>Poor circulation can also weaken your nails. But a weak or compromised immune system is the most common reason for brittle and weak nails. </p>
                        <p>And any one of these issues can put you at risk for ultimately developing toenail fungus. </p>
                        <p>But even with most brittle toenails…you’ll never develop toenail fungus unless there’s a fungus present.</p>

                      <h2 class="nfm-yellow-title-02 lazy" data-src="assets/images/nfm-yellow-title-02.png">root cause #2…</h2>
                      <p>The spread of toenail fungus from person to person…</p>
                      <p>Without a fungus present even someone with the most brittle and unhealthy toenails isn’t going to get toenail fungus.</p>
                      <p>And one way to get toenail fungus is by picking it up from someone else.</p>
                      <p>Toenail fungus is highly contagious. You can get it directly from another person or from something they either wore or used.</p>
                      <img class="lazy" data-src="assets/images/nfm-sub-3-con-img-2.png">
                      <p>That’s why it’s important never to share socks. A person having even a mild fungal infection may not know they have it and could still be contagious.</p>
                      <p>But socks aren’t the only way to pick up a fungus. Things like nail tools and toenail polish should never be shared either.</p>
                      <p>And if you frequent places that are moist and damp like a gym locker room, a public pool or other similar places, it's a good idea to always wear shower shoes.</p>
                      <p>Remember these fungus spores are crafty. They can latch onto anything so if you have Root Cause #1 already and are exposed to a fungal spore, your chances of picking up toenail fungus are pretty high.</p>
                      <p>But outside sources are only one of the ways you can pick up a toenail fungus.</p>

                        <p>But an overgrowth of candida can develop for a number of different reasons. Things like antibiotic use, poor digestive health or compromised immune function are some of the most common reasons.</p>
                        <p>But things like stress, a shift in hormones and a poor diet can also trigger it.</p>
                        <p>And because this yeast overgrowth is internal...treating the external symptoms of toenail fungus will never get rid of it.</p>
                        <p>And it will ALWAYS come back.</p>
                        <p>Why? Because you’ve become a breeding ground for yeast…</p>

          <p>You see, in all of my research what I discovered was that toenail fungus is far more likely to affect your nails if you have a compromised immune system. Now I know what you’re thinking…</p>
          <p>You probably feel as if your immune system is working just fine.</p>

        <div class="nfm-sub-6-con">
          <p>It’s because the fungus responsible spreads in humid, dark, and damp conditions. All it takes is a single spore to reach the nail bed and start the infection.And unfortunately, even if your immune system is off just a little…It won’t be strong enough to target and eliminating nail fungus. You see, immunity works through the blood vessels and circulatory system. And  toenail fungus is hard to get to in order for your body to eliminate it.</p>
