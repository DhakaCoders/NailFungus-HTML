          <p>Over the next few minutes, I’m going to tell you a true yet humiliating story involving a barbeque, a pool party and a pair of closed toed sandals.</p>
          <p>It was the moment I came face-to-face with the fact that toenails fungus could actually ruin my marriage… </p>
          <p>And everyone at the party got to see it all go down.</p>
          <p>Truthfully, it was probably the most embarrassing day of my life.</p>

            <p>The green and yellow oozing mess  that I once called my toenails…</p>
            <p>Had become a petri dish for smelly, disgusting toenail fungus.</p>
            <p>And for years I tried to ignore it...and cover it up.</p>
            <p>But after that day, I couldn't keep lying to myself…</p>
            <p>My once pink and healthy toenails were jagged, eaten away and smelled like  putrid, rotting cheese.</p>
            <p>Forcing me to ALWAYS wear socks...even around my own house.</p>
            <p><strong><u>But that day...pushed me over the edge.</u></strong></p>

          <p>We had just pulled up to my wife Karen’s best friend’s house for a 4th of July pool party.</p>

          <p>The thought of the warm sun, the cool water and the fresh air on my feet sounded to darn good to pass up. But I couldn’t risk the shame and embarrassment. So I grabbed a cold one from the cooler, found a chair and took a load off.</p>
          <p>And for the next 3 hours I sat and watched as everyone else played in the pool…Laid in the sun…Or simply walked around barefoot in the grass.</p>
