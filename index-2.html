          <p>She could barely get the words out.Uh…Carmen…th…this is my hu…husband. It was too late for damage control, my zombie feet where there in all their glory,</p>
          <p>So I quickly stood up trying to bring Carmen's eyes up and away from my feet.</p>
          <p>But it was too late...It was as if her eyes were magnetic and my feet were made from solid iron. She couldn’t help herself. I quickly grabbed her hand and shook it.Trying to engage her in conversation...anything to take her mind off my grotesque feet.</p>
          <p>I felt a terrible wave of shame rush over me. Of course, she was polite about it…But my wife?</p>

          <p>Well…that’s another story.</p>
          <p>She barely talked to me on the drive home. And when we crawled into bed, I made sure to put my socks on and keep my feet as FAR away from her as I could. I felt like a sad little puppy who had soiled the rug. So needing  to be told I was loved, yet  very aware of what I had done. But this wasn’t the first time. Truth be told my wife was repulsed by my toenails and we rarely got close.</p>
          <p>When we did, I ALWAYS had to wear socks. It was humiliating. But that night something changed. I could  feel it. And for the first time in our marriage I was worried we wouldn’t make it.</p>

          <p>That night, I lay awake for hours, staring at the ceiling and feeling my heart constrict in my chest, imagining life without my wife.</p>
          <p>Was this it?  Was I going to lose her over toenail fungus? And if she didn’t want me - would anyone else?</p>
          <p>I tossed and turned all night thinking of how I could finally get rid of this toenail fungus. But what could I  do about it?</p>
          <p>I’d already spent well over three thousands dollars on treatments over the years. No matter how hard I tried, no matter how much money I wasted, no matter how many “specialists” I saw, nothing worked.</p>

          <p>I could ignore the thoughts and the fears swirling around in my head and watch what was left of my marriage slowly disintegrate as we headed for the divorce I knew was in our future if I didn't do something. </p>
          <p>Two, I could get mad and bitter, tell her how shallow she was and play the victim.</p>
          <p>Or three, I could fight for my wife, our family and my dignity.</p>
