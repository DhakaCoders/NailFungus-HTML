I felt like a sad little puppy who had soiled the rug. So needing  to be told I was loved, yet  very aware of what I had done. But this wasn’t the first time. Truth be told my wife was repulsed by my toenails and we rarely got close.</p>
          <p>When we did, I ALWAYS had to wear socks. It was humiliating. But that night something changed. I could  feel it. And for the first time in our marriage I was worried we wouldn’t make it.</p>
