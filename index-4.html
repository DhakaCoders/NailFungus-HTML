        <p>Green tea has a long history in ancient medicine.</p>

        <p>In particular a compound in Green Tea called epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG).</p>

          <p>In fact, studies show that Natural Killer Cells are especially important in the fight against invasive fungal infections.</p>
          <p>The next immune enhancing nutrient is a powerful mushroom complex.</p>
          <p>Including Shitake, Reishi and Maitake mushrooms.</p>

          <p>And based on extensive research it's believed that a mixture of the active ingredients from different mushrooms maximizes the immune response by providing multiple stimuli to the body's natural defenses or host defense.</p>
          <p>Plus, mushrooms  contain an abundance of not only “polysaccharides” but also “protein-bound polysaccharides”, including the much touted beta-D-glucans we talked about earlier, which is one reason they all possess such potent immune-strengthening properties.</p>

          <p>The real question is…Where can you get all of these nutrients in one place. </p>
          <p>Well, the short answer is you can’t. Not in any stores anyway.  That’s because some of these nutrients are very rare. Sure some stores may carry a few of them. But you’re not going to find them all in one place.</p>
          <p><strong><u>In the right dose or the quality you need.</u></strong></p>
          <p>Sure you may be able to find a “generic” immune support that contains some “ok” nutrients. But it’s not going to have the fire power to rid you of toenail fungus. The problem is that if you do want to get your hands on ALL of these power nutrients. </p>
          <p>You’d have to buy them all from different places. You’d find some in a few specialty stores around town and many of them you’d have to find online if you can find them at all. And by the time you did that…</p>
          <p>It would easily cost you upwards of $300. Per month!</p>
          <p>Not to mention you’d be having to choke down a dozen or more  pills each day. And trust me, I know how difficult that can be. Because that’s exactly what I had to do. </p>
