        <p>Green tea has a long history in ancient medicine.</p>
        <p>And more recently science has finally been able to quantify just how powerful Green Tea really is.</p>
        <p>In particular a compound in Green Tea called epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG).</p>
        <p>In one Harvard study published in the journal Food & Function researchers found that EGCG powerfully stimulated the immune system.</p>

          <p>Beta-glucans are sugars that are found in the cell walls of bacteria, fungi, yeasts, algae, lichens, and plants, such as oats and barley.</p>

          <p>In particular they activate macrophages which I told you about earlier and another type of immune cell called natural killer cells.</p>
          <p>Natural killer cells play a significant role in antifungal immunity.</p>

        <div class="nfr-text-module">
          <p>In fact, studies show that Natural Killer Cells are especially important in the fight against invasive fungal infections.</p>
          <p>The next immune enhancing nutrient is a powerful mushroom complex.</p>
          <p>Including Shitake, Reishi and Maitake mushrooms.</p>
          <p>Mushrooms have long been touted for their medicinal benefits and now researchers are starting to see just how powerful they are.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="nfr-text-module">
          <p>And based on extensive research it's believed that a mixture of the active ingredients from different mushrooms maximizes the immune response by providing multiple stimuli to the body's natural defenses or host defense.</p>
          <p>Plus, mushrooms  contain an abundance of not only “polysaccharides” but also “protein-bound polysaccharides”, including the much touted beta-D-glucans we talked about earlier, which is one reason they all possess such potent immune-strengthening properties.</p>
          <p><strong><u>And that’s just a fraction of the immune boosting power nutrients I found.</u></strong></p>
