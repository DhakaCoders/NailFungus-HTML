        <p>Green tea has a long history in ancient medicine.</p>

        <p>In particular a compound in Green Tea called epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG).</p>

          <p>In fact, studies show that Natural Killer Cells are especially important in the fight against invasive fungal infections.</p>
          <p>The next immune enhancing nutrient is a powerful mushroom complex.</p>
          <p>Including Shitake, Reishi and Maitake mushrooms.</p>

          <p>And based on extensive research it's believed that a mixture of the active ingredients from different mushrooms maximizes the immune response by providing multiple stimuli to the body's natural defenses or host defense.</p>
          <p>Plus, mushrooms  contain an abundance of not only “polysaccharides” but also “protein-bound polysaccharides”, including the much touted beta-D-glucans we talked about earlier, which is one reason they all possess such potent immune-strengthening properties.</p>

          <p>The real question is…Where can you get all of these nutrients in one place. </p>
          <p>Well, the short answer is you can’t. Not in any stores anyway.  That’s because some of these nutrients are very rare. Sure some stores may carry a few of them. But you’re not going to find them all in one place.</p>
          <p><strong><u>In the right dose or the quality you need.</u></strong></p>
          <p>Sure you may be able to find a “generic” immune support that contains some “ok” nutrients. But it’s not going to have the fire power to rid you of toenail fungus. The problem is that if you do want to get your hands on ALL of these power nutrients. </p>
          <p>You’d have to buy them all from different places. You’d find some in a few specialty stores around town and many of them you’d have to find online if you can find them at all. And by the time you did that…</p>
          <p>It would easily cost you upwards of $300. Per month!</p>
          <p>Not to mention you’d be having to choke down a dozen or more  pills each day. And trust me, I know how difficult that can be. Because that’s exactly what I had to do. </p>

          <p>And that’s why I brought on a research team…I needed experts to take my data and turn it into something powerful. We needed to take these immune-boosting power nutrients.  And combine them in the best way possible.</p>
          <p>They had to be the purest ingredients available…And they had to be viable, potent and free from contamination. They also had to come from sources with only the highest quality standards. Sources that were held accountable and fully regulated. Once we found our suppliers...We immediately went to work…</p>
          <p>Creating the first immune support formula specifically designed to neutralize embarrassing toenail fungus.</p>

          <p>I mean…</p>
          <p>How much has having disgusting, yellow, thick and creepy toenails cost you in terms of emotional stress and hardship? How many times would you have liked to just take off your shoes and socks and walk barefoot? How many times have you noticed people staring just a little too long at your yellow toenails?  And how does your spouse or significant other react to the sight of your feet?</p>

          <p>And I only say that because I experienced all of that. But I’m here to tell you… It doesn’t have to be that way anymore.</p>
          <p>By simply taking Fungal Nail Pro daily as directed…You’ll soon have toenails like you did when you were in your 20’s…Pink, healthy and strong. Not brittle, yellow and funky.</p>
          <p>And that’s not all.</p>
          <p>With Fungal Nail Pro you’ll also experience all the other health benefits of a healthy immune system…And if you’re skeptical…</p>

As I said before you’ll usually start to see results in as little as 7 days or less…Your nails strengthen, color begins to return to normal and you begin to get a real sense that things are getting better.</p>
          <p>In no time at all. Your feet will look and feel NORMAL again…</p>
          <p>And here’s the best part.</p>
